What research questions are well suited to quantitative analysis and when will
a qualitative approach be better?

## Introduction

{% slide %}
{% notes %}
Before getting started with quantitative research it is important to understand
which questions it can answer. Both Quantitative and qualitative research offer
powerful methods to deliver new insights. They do, however, excel at different
things and it is important to use the right tool for the problem at hand.

## Strengths of Qualitative Methods

There are many research questions that benefit from a qualitative approach. Qualitative research allows us to study how individuals or groups *experience* phenomena of interest. Typically, the focus is on studying people and their experiences in a natural environment to gain a deeper understanding of *how* and *why* a particular behaviour (or other phenomenon of interest) occurs.

Qualitative research relies heavily on the researchers, necessarily subjective, interpretation of observations, interviews, and other data. The data can take many forms, with the only real requirement being that information from the data sources can be processed by the researcher in some way.

As a researcher immerses themselves in the data (and the environment it is collected from) their understanding of the subject matter may change and the design of the study can be adjusted in response to this.

## Qualitative research can

* study how individuals or groups *experience* phenomena of interest.
* study *how* and *why* a particular behaviour occurs.
* utilise a wide range of data sources.
* offer new insights based on the researchers interpretation of these data.
* adapt to an evolving understanding of the subject matter.

{% notes %}
Possible data sources include direct observation, video or audio recordings, interviews,diaries, and other artefacts.

### Qualitative methods have limits

{% notes %}
As a result of the reliance on individual experiences and the researcher's subjective interpretation of the data, qualitative studies are exploratory and can not usually be replicated. The intense engagement with the data required from the researcher means that it isn't, usually, possible to collect large samples.

They are

* exploratory.
* not usually reproducible.
* typically focused on small samples.

## What can Quantitative methods contribute?

Unlike qualitative methods, quantitative research assumes that a single, objective, reality exists and that it can be measured without bias by the researcher. This approach not only allows us to measure traits or properties of interest, it also enables us to measure how they change, e.g., over time or in response to an intervention.

The reliance on objective measurements means that research is reproducible (at least in theory!). Another researcher, using the same protocol to collect data from the same population should be able to arrive at the same conclusions.

{% notes %}
Ensuring data are actually collected in a way that allows objective measurement requires some care. Unlike qualitative studies, quantitative research requires that the study design is determined before any data are collected. This means that clear hypotheses and a detailed understanding of the phenomena under study is required before the research commences.
